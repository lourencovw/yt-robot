                    "Bacon has been a staple in many people's diets for centuries, but do you know when it first appeared on the scene? The earliest records of curing pork dates back to around 1500 BC. The ancient Chinese and Romans both had bacon-like products, and the word ‘bacon’ comes from the Middle English word ‘bakoun’ meaning ‘back meat.’ However, the bacon we are familiar with today was traditionally made in Europe in the 16th century.\n" +

                    'As bacon found its way into kitchens around the world, its popularity grew steadily, and by the Industrial Revolution, bacon became much more widely available. There were numerous ways of curing and smoking bacon, which varied from region to region. In the United States, bacon had an initial surge in popularity during the colonial era, but it wasn’t until the 20th century that Americans truly fell in love with bacon.\n' +

                    'During World War II, the government heavily promoted pork, and this helped to increase its consumption. At the time, bacon was essential for feeding the soldiers, and it wasn’t long before many people began to realize how great it tasted in all kinds of meals. The post-war boom, combined with an increase in mass marketing, helped to cement bacon’s popularity in the United States.\n' +
